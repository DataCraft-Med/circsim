  comment: "Right!  IS and HR are both controlled by the nervous system (theyâ€™re neural variables).  By definition, the DR interval occurs BEFORE any changes in neural firing occurs.  So, there are no changes to these two variables."

  comment: "No, IS and HR are physiologically determined by neural inputs.  Since DR is the interval before there are any changing in the neural signals, there can be no change in IS."
