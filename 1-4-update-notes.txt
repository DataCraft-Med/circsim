  [ ] figure out why the prediction table isn't loading
  [ ] remove references to compass
  [ ] fix the styling on the bottom toolbar

Features to Reimplement: 
  - schematic and help menu
  - tooltips for colums and row

Bugs: 
  - The "reset" implementation I had is creating this problem. I really need to just understand the data model and the progression through the app. Basically, I need to rethink the progression of data through the lifecycle of this application. I think that is what's tripping me up.  I have haphazard resets thrown in.  The framework is functioning fine, but I just have a bunch of shit resets that are going on everywhere. 
  - The above is part and parcel with updating the statechart.  Simplifying the statechart that is.
